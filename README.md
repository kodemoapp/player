# Kodemo

Kodemo is a new format for more engaging and interactive technical documentation. It's great for tutorials and walkthroughs.

## Kodemo Player

This repo contains the @kodemo/player package which is responsible for rendering and navigating Kodemo documents. The player is a React component and it needs to be provided with a valid [Kodemo document](https://kodemo.com/docs/format).

### Installation

To install and integrate @kodemo/player please follow the docs at <https://kodemo.com/docs/player>.

TLDR?

1. Install @kodemo/player using your package manager of choice:

```shell
npm i @kodemo/player # yarn add @kodemo/player
```

2. Import and render the `KodemoPlayer` component:

```js
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client'
import { KodemoPlayer } from '@kodemo/player';

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <KodemoPlayer json={{
      story: '<h1>Example Document</h1>',
      subjects: {
        f992151a: {
          type: 'code',
          name: 'file.js',
          language: "javascript",
          versions: {
            e60944c4: { value: 'const a = 123;', },
          }
        }

### Terminology

If you're planning to work with the Kodemo source here are a few key concepts and names that are good to know about.
- The `story` is the main body text of the documentation.
- `Subjects` are the individual pieces of content that the documentation covers. A subject can be an image, code, etc.
- Subjects can have multiple `versions`. Each version represents a variant of the same subject. For example, multiple versions are used to animate lines being added or removed from code.
- The `timeline` is the bar with vertical line segments that indicate which subject that will become active when scrolling.
- `Effects` are keywords within the story that are linked to a specific subject version. They form the relationship between the story and subjects.
